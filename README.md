# Resume in LaTeX
Inspired by my classmate, I opted for LaTeX to construct my resume and CV because I hated the inconvienence of using Canva, which lacks necessary guidelines to properly adjust document elements. Microsoft Word was my second choice, but I felt it was too dull: a software engineer should showcase her skills and thirst of learning in one way or another. LaTeX was one of the most flexible document preparation software system with support for all sorts of rare symbols. Therefore, I spent around four full days working on a LaTeX template with no prior knowledge and slowly tweaking it to my desired format.
